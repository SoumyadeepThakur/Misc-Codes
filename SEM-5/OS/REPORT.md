# Producer Consumer Problem using Semaphores

## Producer Consumer Problem:

The producer consumer problem also known as the bounded buffer problem is a classic example of a multi-process synchronization problem. The problem invloves two processes, the producer and the consumer. Both these processes share a common, fixed-size buffer. The producer's job is to "produce", i.e., generate data, put it into the buffer and start again. At the same time, the consumer is "consuming", i.e., removing data from the buffer one at a time. The problem is to make sure that the producer won't try to add data into the buffer if it's full and that the consumer won't try to remove data from an empty buffer.
